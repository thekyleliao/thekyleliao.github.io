## This is the current repository for WoGO, a site that is fast and accessible, enabling distribution of interesting technical experiences of various topics to people across the world's educational institutions.

This repo is the static assets produced by Hugo static site generator. We used the theme Hugo-Winston by JugglerX whose theme is on github.
This was for the hackathon, HooHacks2022.
Additions to this repo, hosting the website, may happen. We may choose to make addition or edits to this site to add more content or practice new web development techniques we learned.

Feel free to have our code, Hugo made it anyway, and use it for your own purposes. Feel free to even continue our mission of bringing creative, interesting, tech experiences to a website that is fast and accessible.

I'd like to thank the team, Nandini and Shariar who put up with me. I am utmost apperciative.

To the people, if you don't want to add an experience to our site, look to see if your local instituion would value putting up our link in its computer lab. We want this site to have a real impact and inspire learning. bit.ly/WoGO22
